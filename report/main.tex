\hwtitle{psychic_archer: a TSP solver}{CS 5600}{Parker Michaelson}

\namesection{Usage}

If {\tt Python} is not already installed, do so now. Operation of the solver is controled by uncommenting one or both of the function calls at the bottom of {\tt search.py} in the {\tt code} directory. To gather data on problem size vs. runtime, uncomment the line reading {\tt s.generate_timedata("timeplot.dat")}. To generate solutions to the problem contained in {\tt tsp225.txt}, uncomment the line reading {\tt s.generate_lineplot("pathplot.dat")}. To run both varients sequentially, uncomment both lines. As an alternative to editing the source file, you might also run the python interpreter and load {\tt search.py}. To adjust the maximum runtime (100000 seconds by default), provide an alternative timespan as an argument to the constructor of {\tt SolutionSearch}. One may also provide an alternative problem file to the code by the same method.

To create a problem size vs. time plot, move the resultent data file ({\tt timeplot.dat}) to the {\tt timeplot} directory and run {\tt gnuplot} with {\tt timeplot.plot} as an argument. Similarly for the other plot, move {\tt pathplot.dat} to the {\tt pathplot} directory and run {\tt gnuplot} on the {\tt pathplot.plot} file.

\namesection{{\tt search_d} Heuristic}

{\tt search_d} uses a heuristic that chooses the next node to be as close as possible to the start node. Based on data from {\tt logs/biglog.txt}, {\tt search_d} is a slight improvement over {\tt search_c}.

\namesection{Results}

Experiments were conducted under Slackware 14.0, running on a Dual Core Intel processor. Due to time constraints and the corruption of a data file, the time limit for most of the experiments was kept to under 10 seconds. While this is not especially useful, we can conclude from the problem size vs. runtime plot that for small problems, {\tt search_b} was the most efficient search, possibly due to the cost of computing heuristics for {\tt search_c} and {\tt search_d}. Near the end of the corrupted data file {\tt logs/biglog.txt}, however, we observe {\tt search_c} becoming faster than {\tt search_b} and {\tt search_d} becoming faster that {\tt search_c}.

The problem size vs. runtime plot may be found in the {\tt timeplot} directory, while shortest path plots for each search may be found in the {\tt pathplot} directory, each of which was run for 200 seconds.
